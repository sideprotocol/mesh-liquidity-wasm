# ibcswap-wasm

The current state of the project is still in development and not yet ready for production use. 

ibcswap-wasm is a Cosmwasm implementation of the ICS 100 and ICS 101 specifications within the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol of the Cosmos ecosystem. ICS 100 specifies the atomic swap functionality, while ICS 101 specifies the interchain swap functionality. As a community-driven project, ibcswap-wasm aims to provide a secure and efficient solution for cross-chain token exchanges, following the ICS 100 and ICS 101 specifications. Currently in active development, ibcswap-wasm holds the potential to enable seamless interoperability between Cosmos-based blockchains and empower decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.
